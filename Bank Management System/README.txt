Prerequisites:

1. Python: Ensure Python is installed on your system. The code is compatible with Python 3.x.

Installation:
Download Python from python.org.

2. MySQL Server: The code uses MySQL for database management. You need to have MySQL Server installed and running.

Installation:
Download MySQL Community Server from dev.mysql.com.

3. MySQL Connector for Python: This is a Python library that allows Python to interact with MySQL databases.

pip install mysql-connector-python

4.Tkinter: Tkinter is used for the graphical user interface (GUI). It is included with Python, but if itâ€™s not installed on your system, you might need to install it separately.

sudo apt-get install python3-tk


ADDITIONAL STEP

1. Create the Database and Tables: Ensure you create the Bank database in MySQL before running the code:
CREATE DATABASE Bank;

2. Modify Database Connection Settings: Make sure to adjust the connect_db function if your MySQL configuration differs (e.g., if you are using a different username, password, or host).
